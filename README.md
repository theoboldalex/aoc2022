# Advent of Code Solutions 2022

Decided to go with Python this year to change things up a bit.

If you want to run the solutions do the following after cloning this repo.

```shell
cp .env.example .env
```

Then grab the session cookie from your AoC input page and paste into the `COOKIE` env var.

Just run the solutions then with `python3` command or run the tests with `pytest`.
